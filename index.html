    <h2> Let's talk about Eggplant Lasagna! </h2>
    <hr style="height: 10px;px;border-width:7;color:rgb(179, 63, 63);background-color:rgb(85, 184, 146)">
    <p> As a person who loves meat and rarely eats lasagna, I never thought my one of my<br>favorite recipes would be Eggplant Lasagna.
        Sometimes I like to have my Eggplant deep fried and other times I may pan sear it.<br>To get the best flavor, marinating the eggplant in tasty herbs and making the sauce from scratch will yield the best results!
        <br> And you <b>definitely</b> can't forget the freshly grated cheese! Not only is this a delicious dish and easy to prepare, it's healthy and light!<br> Perfect for meatless Mondays or if you're looking to cut back on heavy meals.<br>
